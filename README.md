## 3. AI Model & Extraction Flow
- **Model:** Google Gemini API
- **How it works:**
  1. User uploads a resume (PDF/DOC/DOCX).
  2. Text is extracted from the file.
  3. The text is sent to Gemini with a prompt emphasizing a concise, professional summary and skill extraction.
  4. Gemini returns structured JSON (summary, skills, work experience, etc.), which is saved in the database.
